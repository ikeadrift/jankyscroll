## [<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>](#welcome-to-github-pages)Welcome to **jankyscroll**

Jankyscroll makes your website's UX undeniably worse. Let's talk about a couple ways you could delude yourself into thinking you want this.

1.  First and foremost, **jankyscroll** is a tool for randomized, organic content discovery. With it, users can unintentionally (and forcibly!) discover parts of your website that they didn't know or care about, and probably still won't. Maybe that's something you want. I don't know.

2.  In today's diverse ecosystem, it can be a real challenge to support every available platform. Solutions like [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) do their best to help you adapt to and support all manner of devices, but **jankyscroll** elegantly resolves all issues. Performance will be as terrible on a brand new, state-of-the-art machine as it was on your dad's old Compaq that caught fire that one time.

3.  For too long, content providers have allowed ungrateful _users_ to scroll wherever they please, whenever they please. With **jankyscroll**, you can assert your rightful dominance as a Provider of Value, and stop those thankless users from scrolling so freely. Control the Scroll, with **jankyscroll**. It sucks.

## [<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>](#how-to)How to use **jankyscroll**

If you really want to use **jankyscroll**, I guess I can't stop you. First, you would include it in your page, like this. You should already know this stuff, probably.

    <script src="your/path/to/jankyscroll.js"></script>

Then, call the function, probably at the bottom of your document.

    <script jankyscroll(trigger_distance, jank_amount);></script>

_trigger_distance_ sets the distance, in pixels, that one has to scroll before they get jank'd. _jank_amount_ sets an approximate range of how jank'd they'll be, also in pixels.

    <script jankyscroll(400, 50);></script>

For instance, the above code would mean that the user would be jank'd by about 50px for every 400px scrolled. Thankfully, that's all. If your _jank_amount_ is greater than your _trigger_distance_, that might cause some problems. Who cares.

Having trouble with **jankyscroll**? Sorry, I don't really know what to do about that. It's sort of trouble to begin with, no? I'm sure you'll figure it out.

<del>It doesn't work on mobile, because I have homework to do tonight. If someone wants to pull request that, I'll probably laugh at you for wasting your time on this bullshit, but then accept it. So, you know, go for it.</del> Nevermind, it totally does. If someone was in the middle of working on this, I'm sorry, but that only makes it more funny.
